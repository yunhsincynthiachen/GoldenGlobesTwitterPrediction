David Oyelowo isn't going to win either, and neither will Selma ðŸ˜“
@Jasinjuh It's incredible. David Oyelowo will probably win best actor. Strong case for best picture too. You should see it.

@ediological David oyelowo will win best actor tonight .
@KristianHarloff David Oyelowo was amazing in Selma, but, Michael Keaton is still my pick for Best Actor.  I think Keaton will win.
Do you think Cumberbatch will win on Sunday? He's up against Steve Carell, Jake Gyllenhaal, David Oyelowo &amp; Eddie Redmayne
@Samantha_Goble I just saw Selma! David Oyelowo will win the golden globe. I found out he's English. Mind blown!!
