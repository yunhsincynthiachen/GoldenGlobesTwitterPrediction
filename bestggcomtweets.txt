Birdman will win Best Comedy too.
Personally Birdman was a little too Americanised for my tastes but I understand why it will win awards. Acting was very good though

Keaton may win for Birdman, but he will be remembered in history for Batman.

Good luck to the nominees of "The Imitation Game", "Wild", "Pride", "St. Vincent" &amp;... http://t.co/z4eu6v9QkK
I think @BirdmanMovie  will win best comedy, but I thought that both St. Vincent and The Grand Budapest Hotel  were better #GoldenGlobes.
Any @goldenglobes predictions out there? I enjoyed Whiplash, so JK Simmons gets my vote. Also liked St.Vincent, but think Birdman will win.
I SWEAR IF ST. VINCENT DOESN'T WIN HER GRAMMY I WILL RAISE HELL üòê

@torrancecoombs So do you think your favorite movie - Grand Budapest Hotel will win?
I will be so sad if The Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't win for best comedy or musical, it's such a good movie.
Prediction: Grand Budapest Hotel will win for most film formats in a motion picture
It will never win, but ILU, Grand Budapest Hotel
I just loved "The Grand Budapest Hotel" As much as I would love to see it win, I just don't think it will.
IF NIGHTCRAWLER, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, OR BIRDMAN WIN ANY OF THEIR CATEGORIES I WILL BE SO HAPPY
more mad that The Grand Budapest Hotel will now likely win nothing
If @PrideMovieUK doesn't win the #GoldenGlobes, I will abandon my love of pop culture forever. #ForRealBestMovieIveSeenInYears #Pride

Haven't even seen Into The Woods but I wanted Blunt to win. Her time will come...
I will forever be bitter and disappointed that she did not win. She made Into the Woods! #EmilyBlunt #GoldenGlobes
If Into The Woods doesn't win anything. I will be pissed...
