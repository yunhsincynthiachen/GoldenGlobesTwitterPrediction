i just want you all to know: if quvenzhane wallis doesn't win tonight there will be blood
I have this strong feeling Emily Blunt will win tomorrow but how interesting it would be if Quvenzhané Wallis snatched it? (K, I'm stopping)
sorry, ruth wilson you can win awards but you will never be emily blunt.
Emily Blunt didn't win her award at the #GoldenGlobes for #IntoTheWoods. But she put in a great performance and will always have that :D
Will never not be bitter that Emily Blunt didn't win this
EMILY BLUNT. I WILL FLIP IF SHE DOESNT WIN. I WILL FLIP THIS TABLE BOLTED TO THE FLOOR.
