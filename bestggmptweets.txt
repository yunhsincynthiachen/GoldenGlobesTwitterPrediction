Woah the gays are winning big time tonight! Maybe The Imitation Game will win Best Drama?
Wich is gonna win for best drama film? My guess is The Imitation Game. My favorite is Boyhood. #GoldenGlobes
@Fery_umi: If the Imitation Game wins tonight wins Best Drama Film, Boyhood for sure will win Best Picture at the Oscars.
The Imitation Game was better than The Theory of Everything, but Eddie Redmayne will probably win the Golden Globe for Best Drama Actor.

Gee I wonder what will win Best Drama? #Boyhood #GoldenGlobes
I won't be shocked if Boyhood doesn't win Best Drama but I will burn this place to the ground. #GoldenGlobes

Selma will win Best Drama and will win the Oscar. I'm hoping Grand Budapest Hotel will take Comedy/Musical but it might be Birdman.
Selma will win Golden Globe for Best Drama. Book it.
